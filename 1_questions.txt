Add the value “goblin” to an instance of mutable data types in Python. If a key/value pair is necessary, use the key “attack”:
- mylist.append(“goblin”)
- mylist.add(“goblin”)
- mydict[“attack”] = goblin
Suppose we have a dictionary called groceries. Write an expression to obtain the value of the key “carrots”.
- groceries[“carrots”]
- groceries.get(“carrots”)
